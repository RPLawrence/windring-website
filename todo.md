Eventually, real-time grid status, visitors and region status will be shown.

I am also developing a Rails app to manage users, assets, and regions. Quite an ambitious project as it turns out.
(Don't worry, I am not playing with the 'live' database.)

This site has been generated with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and uses the minima theme. This is all well and good but I will be writing my own theme using [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) in the near future.
